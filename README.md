## About

The dark web is a part of the internet not indexed by standard search engines. Often associated with illegal activities, it also hosts many legitimate resources, including privacy tools, secure communication platforms, and research databases. This website and repository aim to provide access to these legitimate resources.

## Website

The Dark Web Links website is a static HTML directory of curated resources. Designed to be accessible and functional even with JavaScript disabled in the Tor Browser, it prioritizes security and privacy. The site is structured for easy navigation, allowing users to quickly find relevant resources.

**Access the website:** [https://user69blood.github.io/darkweb.github.io/](https://user69blood.github.io/darkweb.github.io/)

## Security Best Practices

Accessing the dark web requires careful attention to security. For detailed instructions and best practices, please see our [Secure Access Guide](https://user69blood.github.io/darkweb.github.io/guides/secure-access.html). Here are some essential tips summarized:

*   **Use the Tor Browser:** The Tor Browser is a specially configured browser that routes your traffic through the Tor network, providing anonymity.
*   **Use a VPN (Optional but Recommended):** A VPN can add an extra layer of security by masking your IP address.
*   **Be Careful What You Click:** Only visit trusted websites. Avoid clicking on suspicious links.
*   **Don't Share Personal Information:** Never share your real name, address, or other personal information on the dark web.
*   **Keep Your Software Updated:** Ensure your Tor Browser and other security software are up-to-date.
